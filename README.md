# Welcome to my Python For Everybody repository!

Here you'll find learning exercises that I completed as part of the Python for Everybody cirriculum.

Also included are projects I worked on from Scientific Computing with Python (freeCodeCamp), in order to solidify this knowledge.

Thanks for checking this out!
